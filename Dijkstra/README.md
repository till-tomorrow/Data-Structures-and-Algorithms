Dijkstra's Algorithm

This is an OOP implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm. 
Dijk class takes an object of class WtGraph in its constructor.
findSPT method takes in source vertex as argument and computes the Shortest Path Tree. 
retSPT method prints the distances from the source to every other vertex and returns a WtGraph containing the shortest path tree
tracePath method takes destination as argument and prints the path from the source to that destination along with the total distance of the path.
